GoogleMapSDKiOS-Storyboards
===========================

How to use the Google Maps SDK in iOS Storyboards. 

This project is configured to work with the Google Maps SDK for iOS. The project files contain the final version of the
application with a UIView containing the google map. The main idea is to add google maps functionality using
Xcode Storyboards. This gives a great amount of flexibility in customiizing the look of the app by treating
the GMSMapView as just another UIView object.
